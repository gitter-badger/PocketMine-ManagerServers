#PocketMine-ManagerServers
PocketMine-ManagerServers is a program that is able to install and manage servers for PocketMine-MP! (Others will be added in future thanks to your requests!)

## How it works PocketMine-ManagerServers?
It's use is very simple! It will begin with a call screen in the main menu which lists the functions of the program.

The current functions of the program are:
- Installation PocketMine-MP
- Management servers
- Program options
- Credits
- Exit

###Installation PocketMine-MP
The function itself says it does, install the system creating servers for Minecraft PE (Pocket Edition)
After selecting the item appear other two items: a download and installation.
First you will need to download the beating heart of PocketMine, then select the version you want to download, and the download will start automatically! Once you download the indicated link to the folder where you saved it and go to the installation phase! It too will have procedures similar but different tasks. The difference lies in having to specify the connection folder in which you want to install the server, that's all!

###Management servers
This function provides for the management of one or more servers (maximum 10). It includes other two functions: one to open the servers and the other to change the performance.

######Opener
The first function is simple to use, though in the past they had already indicated the connections will not be referred to a second time while on the contrary, if they had not shown connections now you will have to do and then go on.

######Editor
The second function is also divided into two functions: one that changes the properties of the servers (server.properties) and one which changes the performance (High, medium, low).

The first is simple to use, you just need to specify the properties to be attributed to the servers and create the file and place it will show where

The second asks you to choose which you want to assign to the performance servers, always pointing to the links folder (as 
noted previously)

######Backup & Restore
This function implemented with version 1.1 allows you to create backup files whenever you like , for your server and wanting can also restore them !

###Options
The section includes two feature options, the first very simply allows you to change the language of the program, the second reset settings and, depending on your choice, delete the data of the servers or the program (**Must be used with great caution!!**)

###Exit
Exit the program :S
