## How to install PocketMine-ManagerServers
There are 2 type of versions for PocketMine-ManagerServers:

- **Beta versions (Builds)**: It's the last build with new fuctions added in future version.

### Stable version
If you [download](https://github.com/matcracker/PocketMine-ManagerServers/releases) a stable version from v1.1 to v1.2 when you run the setup and finished the installation, you must go to the directory folder (**C:\Program Files\PocketMine-ManagerServers**) and move the DLL file (**Ionic.Zip.dll**) from the folder "Libraries" into the main folder.
